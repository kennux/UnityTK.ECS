# DISCONTINUED

This project is discontinued, Prototype functionality will be reimplemented in UnityTK.
Apart from that i havent yet seen much things that would fit in this UnityTK submodule.

I might pick this project up again in the future when ECS is more stable and extensive.

# UnityTK.ECS

This is a UnitTK module for unity's ECS (Entity Component System).
It contains utility code and other toolkit functionality for the entity component system.
WARNING: Since unity's ECS is constantly changing this repository may drastically change from day to day.
Use it with caution in production!

# How to use

You can use UnityTK.ECS as git submodule:

`git submodule init`  
`git submodule add https://github.com/kennux/UnityTK.ECS`

In order to sync the UnityTK.ECS submodule code to your unity project the bash script in Utility/update_unitytk_ecs.sh can be used.
